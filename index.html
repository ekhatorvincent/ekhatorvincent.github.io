     <h1>Nigeria rice and stew </h1>

<p>An easy and quick recipe for Nigeria food
        Nigerian tomato stew is a favourite in every Nigerian <br/>home and there’s nothing as tasty and simple as white rice and tomato stew. I have always loved tomato <br/>stew and white rice as we fondly call it in Nigeria. I love making my own stew but I also enjoy tasting stew made <br/>by other people, it’s always amazing how stew can<br/> have different unique flavors and tastes when prepared by different people even <br/>with the same ingredients. Stew is very versatile as it can be served with different <br/> types of sides such as steamed rice, boiled or fried yam, plantains, potatoes, egusi soup, okra soup and even bread…Yes, <br/>I love stew and fresh ‘out of the oven bread’ </p>
